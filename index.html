        <p>I love cricket because it is purest form of love. The joy of watching your team do well, the uncertainties it brings and the sheer happiness. Sometimes you lose the unloseables and sometimes you manage to pull off a miracle. The game is such a leveler. On some days, you take a 5-for within a space of few balls. On other days your figures read 111-0. That is how it is.
        <br><br>
        Other reason why I love cricket so much is because cricket is another simulation of life. Life, like cricket has a set of rules and the challenge is to do well by using your resources in the most optimal way and be the best version of yourself.
        <br><br>
        Cricket teaches optimism. Your team may have lost 11 games in a row and all seems so bleak, but you still don't give up. Things will turn around if you keep working hard. The beast of momentum and confidence will take you to some very elite places. Cricket is simple. Everyone is told the rules beforehand and now the challenge is to do the task better than the opposition. Not much complication. It is unadulterated and sacred.
        <br><br>
        I love Cricket because it is hard to go on top and stay there no matter how good you are. They say that "there is loneliness at top", never ever this statement has made more sense to me than watching the cricketers do their job. You may be playing with 10 other mates, but in reality none can really come to rescue you. Your figures will remain yours. There is no hiding place unlike many other sports. For example: In Football you may not have scored any goal or done assists and yet have a great game, not in Cricket. Cricket is bloody hard. It pushes ourselves to the places we didn't even know existed.
        <br><br>
        Lastly, I love Cricket because it is a journey of self-discovery. You hardly know yourself unless you learn to appreciate cricket. The taste of defeat, the delight in winning, the heart-breaks, losing on the last ball, managing a draw, tied games, battling and battling till you pass out. Ah! Life is easy. Cricket is hard.</p>
